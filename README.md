gocat
=====

### Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonvaldes/gocat.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jonvaldes/gocat)

gocat is a simple wrapper over the "adb logcat" command which lets you
filter unwanted messages from the logcat output via regexps.

Also, it has a color-highlighting mechanism you can use to make specific
errors more visible.

To install it, if you have Go installed, simply do:

    go get github.com/jonvaldes/gocat

There are also [win/lin/mac builds available for tagged releases here](https://github.com/jonvaldes/gocat/releases)
